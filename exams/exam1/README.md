# Zool 719 Macroevolution
# Exam 1
## Due: February, 11 2026

### Instructions  
This exam is in class, on Wednesday February 11, 2026. You are encouraged to develop your answers in advance but you must write it by hand in class. You may verbally discuss questions with each other in real time (in person, phone, or video chat), but you must not share written answers (no texting, messaging, email, etc.), and all answers must be your own work. Please do not abuse this policy.  

Please write your answers by hand, and please try to be concise. That is, __directly answer the questions, providing specific examples as necessary to support your statement__. No fluff. (As a rough guide, less than 2 college-ruled pages per question). Please answer three of the four questions.  

### Things to consider: 
* I will expect you to understand the __arguments and definitions__ presented in the readings, and to articulate them in your answers.
* I will want you know what **you think** about them and to _support your views with evidence_ from the readings.
* There is no single right answer, but there are views that are supported by evidence and those that are not supportable. 

### Questions  
1. Why is Sexual Selection needed by Darwin in addition to Natural Selection? What does Sexual Selection explain that Natural Selection cannot? Please be specific and complete, providing examples to make your case, and include any necessary definitions in your answer (_do this for all of the questions_). 


2. What is adaptation and how is it different from natural selection? Compare and contrast the views of Darwin, Simpson, Mayr, and Miller on the role of adaptation in evolutionary theory. Did these authors worry about the ability to test adaptations, and what ideas, if any, did they have to do so? 


3. Compare and contrast the views of Darwin, Simpson, Mayr, and Miller on the reality of higher taxa, and how they arise, and the role of adaptive zones. Are these concepts of how clades become higher taxa consistent with Darwinʻs 5 theories of evolution? Explain. 


4. How would Lewontinʻs criteria for natural selection (phenotypic variation, differential fitness, and heritability of fitness) apply to selection targetted on genes, individuals, kin, and populations; and could selection at different levels possibly lead to different evolutionary [or outcomes]? Or do you believe that selection at different levels can always be reduced to individual selection? Is selection on higher levels possible (e.g., species or higher taxa) and better explain key innovations as discussed by Simpson or any of the other authors? (why or why not)

(Old version of #4 - __do not use__) Is selection is generalizable to levels below and above the individual? Does Lewontin suggest different mechanisms and/or different consequences of selection at these different levels of the biological heirarchy? Are these different levels of selection necessary to explain novel evolutionary phenomena?
