# Development - How the Turtle got its Shell

## \[[The Papers are in the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ftgXSMARxGUhPHBGKkJN48lKBJC6Ji-m)\]

This is the first illustration in our discussions of how major macroevolutionary change can come about via the evolution of development.

We will focus on the turtle shell. There are two recurring questions: evolutionary origination, and evolutionary modification. Often the origin question is much harder to explain than the modifications. Specifically: _What caused the turtle to evolve a shell?_ and _How have turtle shells changed over evolutionary time?_. 

Many aspects of turtle evolution have been challenging. Where turtles fit within vertebrates have been debated until very recently. So it is no surprise that the orgin of the turtle shell has been an enigma.

An accessible summary of the new developmemtal insights on how turtles evolved their shells. Contains references to insights from paleontology as well. Pay attention to changes in the __order__ and __timing__ of development of morphological structures (including rate of growth). Another important developmental event is changes in spatial arrangment (which cells touch and signal additional developmental events). 

_Heterochrony_: Evolutionary change in the __timing__ of development, relative to an ancesstor.

_Heterotopy_: Evolutionary change in the __spatial location__ of development or arrangement of a trait during development, relative to an ancestor.

_Homology_: "the possession by two or more species of a trait, with or without modification, from their common ancestor" (Futyuma 1986, pg. 552)
