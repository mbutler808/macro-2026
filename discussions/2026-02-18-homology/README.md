Here we explore integration of development and evolution.

Wagner's writings on homology have been critical in forming a synthesis of developmental biology and evolutionary biology. Of his various papers on homology, this one is still my favorite general overview. Pay close attention to the three fundamental properties of biological homology. How does Wagner's approach to homology differ from Pattersonʻs (who equated homology with synapomorphy, and I will summarize)? __map: Manuel__

_Homology_: "the possession by two or more species of a trait, with or without modification, from their common ancestor" (Futyuma 1986, pg. 552)
