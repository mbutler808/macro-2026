These readings get at variational properties of organisms. In other words, how variation is produced.

## The Origins of Evolvability 

22. __Wagner, G. P., Altenberg, L. 1996__ Perspective: Complex adaptations and the evolution of evolvability. _Evolution_ 50(3):967-976. __map:Taren__

- A very interesting and thought provoking paper on evolvability, evo-devo, and computational biology.

24. __Wagner, G. P. 1988__ The significance of developmental constraints for phenotypic evolution by natural selection. Pp. 222-229 in G. de Jong (ed.) _Population Genetics and Evolution_, Springer-Verlag, Berlin.

- The first paper to show that developmental constraints could enhance rather than just inhibit adaptive evolution by natural selection. This paper was critical in the synthesis of structuralist and functionalist approaches to the study of form, and made the concept of developmental constraint more accessible to hardcore Darwinians. Note the structure of the corridor models of adaptation.
