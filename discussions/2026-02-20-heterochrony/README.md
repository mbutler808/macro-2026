A classic paper giving formal definitions of the standard patterns and processes of heterochrony, especially as relevant to changes occurring relatively late in ontogeny (retroactively termed "de Beerian heterochrony" by many authors). This is the standard scheme against which others are compared. 

Pay attention to how they propose a scheme to understand major changes by changes ("perturbations") in ontogenetic trajectory, focusing on the parameters: timing of the start and stop in developent, and changes to growth rate to produce any change in shape. Developmental events can be related to time or size. 


__Heterochrony:__ The evolutionary change in the timing of development.

__Von Bayerʻs Four laws of embryology (1828):__
1. […] the more general characters of a large group appear earlier in the embryo than the more special characters.
2. From the most general forms the less general are developed, and so on, until finally the most special arises.
3. Every embryo of a given animal form, instead of passing through the other forms, rather becomes separated from them.
4. Fundamentally, therefore, the embryo of a higher form never resembles any other form, but only its embryo. 

__Haeckelʻs Biogenetic law (1866)__ "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"
- Coined the term "heterochrony" to indicate deviations from the Biogenetic law. 

__SJ Gould (1977)__ "Ontogeny and Phylogeny" 
- Argues that you can get punctuated change through evolutionary changes in development "Saltational change"

_Homology_: "the possession by two or more species of a trait, with or without modification, from their common ancestor" (Futyuma 1986, pg. 552)  __map:Taren__
