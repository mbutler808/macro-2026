### Readings and Annotations

7. (Origin cont'd, [ch6](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/42663184), [ch14](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/42663472) ) Darwin, C. 1859. *On the Origin of Species*. First Edition. John Murray, London. (Chapters 6, 14; pgs. 171-206,459-490)  

Chapter 6 "Difficulties on Theory" is a very interesting read. Pay particular attention to what he identifies as difficulties, and why, as these frame the important debates. Be able to discuss the arguments and evidence used to resolve his point of view. 

Chapter 14 "Recapituation and Conclusion". Can we distill the entire argument into clear and simple statements? How would you arrange the argument into its most essential and subsidiary points? 

8. [Darwin, C. 1871](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/20266196). *The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex*. John Murray, London. (Chapter 21; pgs. 368-387)  

Chapter 21 "General Summary and Conclusion". A little more than half the book is an argument that humans are a part of the biological world, and as such, are subject to evolution. The second half of the book is a thorough treatment of sexual selection and how it is important enough to distinguish from natural selection. What differentiates the two forms of selection? Why is it needed? And why is this paired with his thoughts on man?
