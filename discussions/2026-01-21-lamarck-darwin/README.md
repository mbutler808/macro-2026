## Darwinism and Macroevolution

### Ernst Mayr 1904 - 2005

[Ernst Mayr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mayr) \[[NAS biographical memoir](https://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/mayr-ernst.pdf)\] was an ornithologist, evolutionary biologist, one of the authors of the modern synthesis, and later a philosopher of science. 

Mayr was born in Germany and like many biologists of his age was expected to become a physician. However, he loved birds, and during his studies was encourged to pursue ornithology through museum work by his mentor Professor Stresemann. He completed his doctoral dissertation in ornithology at the age of 21. During his disseration he went on field collecting trips in the tropics, includuing New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, where he saw unprecedented diversity and described dozens of species. These field experiences were no doubt very inflential in his thinking and his later ideas on reproductive isolation, the biological species concept, and peripatric speciation. 

Mayr moved to the US in 1931 to take an appointment at the American Museum of Natural History. In 1942 he wrote _Systematics and the Origin of Species_, one of the books that expanded "Darwinism" into the _modern synthesis_ of Mendelian genetics, systematics, and Darwinian evolution. Mayr was aslo very influential in birding societies and influencing ornithological reseach, which in America had become very taxonomically oriented. He encouraged the study of living birds, field trips, and natural history observations, and for all birders to study a research problem of their own. Mayr seemed to enjoy vigorous debate and was critical of early mathetmatical approches to evolution, Dawkinʻs focus on genes as the target of selection, and reductionsim. He thought about visibility to selection and more integrative views considering the whole organism. 

### Readings and Annotations

Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) - Was a French naturalist and early evolutionist who pre-dated Darwin. He believed that organisms evolved following natural laws and produced the first comprehensive theory of evolution. As an impoverished aristocrat, he had to work as a soldier, bank clerk, and many other professions before finding sufficient employment as a biologist. He wrote extensively in order to solidify his reputation, and made extensive observations of the natural world resulting from his voyages and study of materials. He began as a botanist and then moved on to molluscs. 

In 1801 publishing "Syteme des Animaux san Vertebres", a major work on the classification of invertebrates. He was one of the first to use the term "biology", and proposed natural groups categorizing echinoderms, arachnids, crustaceans, and annelids, which he separated from "worms". 

He was an early "transformist", i.e., that species change through time, but he is most remembered for is his mechanism of evolution by the inheritance of acquired characters, otherwise known as "Lamarckian evolution". This theory had two parts: Use and disuse -- that organs used more frequently by animals would be strenthened through use (and atrophy if disused), and Inheretance of those aquired characters -- thus beneficial characters can be transmitted to offspring. He also believed that the environmental context was somehow important for the direction of change in animals ("the adaptive force"), and that evolution was progressive -- that species evolve toward continued complexity ("the complexifying force") -- or orthogenesis. The inheritance of acquired characters became controversial and later discredited. But we should remember that he came to these mechanisms by trying to explain what he observed in the natural world. The irony, of course, is that while he got some parts wrong as we understand evolution today, we are now finding potential mechanims for "Lamarckian evolution" today. 

Lamarck was clearly brilliant and hard-working. However his writings are very long, and I could not find a reasonable length exerpt. Thus we selected this Gould essay on Lamarck.

Mayr, E. (1985) - the best summary that I know of the major components of Darwinian evolutionary theory as synthesized in the mid twentieth century by Mayr and others. The subsequent history of macroevolution consists largely of controversies concerning whether and how these principles provide a complete and satisfactory foundation for macroevolutionary studies.
