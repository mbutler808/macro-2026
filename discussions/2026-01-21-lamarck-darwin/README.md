Mayr, E. (1982) - the philosophical foundations of biological science discussed by a major contributor to the evolutionary synthesis. Mayr's emphasis on quality of concepts and theory as the measure of a science is central to this course. This assignment introduces _hypothetico-deductivism_, _comparative methodology_, _essentialism versus populational thinking_, _hierarchy_, and _reductionism_, all of which are major themes of macroevolution. This is the best concise coverage of these issues that I know.

Mayr, E. (1985) - the best summary that I know of the major components of Darwinian evolutionary theory as synthesized in the mid twentieth century by Mayr and others. The subsequent history of macroevolution consists largely of controversies concerning whether and how these principles provide a complete and satisfactory foundation for macroevolutionary studies.
