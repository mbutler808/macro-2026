## A new structure of evolutionary theory

This is a graduate course exploring how macroevolutionary ideas around the
generation of biodiversity are changing with new ideas on the
roles of development, epigenetic mechanisms, and microbiome
that expand evolutionary possibilities beyond the Modern
Synthesis.

We will conduct close reading of major papers in evolutionary biology to sharpen critical thinking skills and deepen understanding of the major ideas in the field of macroevolution, beginning with Darwin, the Modern Synthesis, and papers guided by the new book *Evolution Evolving: The Developmental Origins of Adaptation and Biodiversity*. 

### __Mechanics:__  
The course will meet twice weekly WF 10:30-11:45am. Each session will involve a reading and small group discussion. Students will demonstrate understanding in take-home midterms on the readings. Grading: Students will be graded 25% on participation, and 75% on 3 midterms.
